# **Unique Features** 
## **Grid Music Selection**
Inspired on DDR A music select screen, AccelBeat features a very similar navigation fashion, containing sort modes and togglable song groups that remembers the player's selection between game sessions. 

## **Chart Filter**
You can choose to display all charts, singles that can be played on multiplayer or charts that requires two sides doubles that can only be played if only one side is joined. This option is only enabled for single-player. 

## **Music Search**
Type `Ctrl+F` in music select to search for any song title or artist. The results display all matches, which can also be filtered for singles and doubles.

## **Sorted Difficulties** 
Unlike most themes, charts are sorted by type, and then by meter difficulty, making it even easier to find what you're looking for.

## **Editor Tools** 
Quickly toggle between Music Rate 100% and 50%, and control the playback notefield speed with hotkeys during edit mode, without having to access any menu.

## **Chart and Options Preview (coming soon)** 
With a custom-made options list that can be accessed at any time during the music select screen, you can preview not only the options you just selected, but also the currently selected chart.
